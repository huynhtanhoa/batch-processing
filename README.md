# Batch-Service
 a service that imports data from a CSV spreadsheet, transforms it with custom code, and stores the final results in a database.

A customer or a business analyst supplies a spreadsheet, this spreadsheet contains a first name and a last name on each row, separated by a comma. This is a fairly common pattern that Spring can handle without customization.
